# Beer UI, Oxbury assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Installed eslint and prettier packages to make development smoother.
Added Continuous integration script to ensure constant linting and formatting checks.

Notes -
Needs more testing, not sure where to implement this other than on the functions currently.

Pagenation buttons at the bottom of the screen do not update as filter function takes place, unsure how to implement this sadly.
